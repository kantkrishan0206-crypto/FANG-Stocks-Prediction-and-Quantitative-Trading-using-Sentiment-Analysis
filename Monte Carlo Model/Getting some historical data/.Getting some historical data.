Getting some historical data.
Stock Price Prediction using machine learning is the process of predicting the future value of a stock traded on a stock exchange for reaping profits. With multiple factors involved in predicting stock prices, it is challenging to predict stock prices with high accuracy, and this is where machine learning plays a vital role.

We will be building our LSTM models using Tensorflow Keras and preprocessing our data using scikit-learn. These imports are used in different steps of the entire process, but it is good to club these statements together. Whenever we wish to import something new, just add the statement arbitrarily to the below group.
